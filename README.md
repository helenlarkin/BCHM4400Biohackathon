Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome

A rare genetic condition that causes rapid aging beginning in childhood.
It is a caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene and is always fatal.
This disease affects 1 in 4 million newborns worldwide.
Children are typically healthy at birth and start showing symptoms in their first 2 years of life.
Some of the symptoms include growth failure, low body weight, aged-looking skin, joint stiffness, cardiovascular problems, stroke, high-pitched voice, delayed dentition, insulin resistance, small lower jaw.

Diagnostic Criteria:
Clinical examination, Genetic Testing- 1824C>T mutation in exon 11 is common, Radiological Studies, Skin Biopsy, Lipid Profile and Cardiovascular Assessment

Prognostic Factors:
Age of Onset, Rate of Growth Failure, Cardiovascular Health, Access to Treatment, Genetic Factors
*There is currently no cure for this disease so, treatments function to extend lifespan.
The average lifespan for children with HGPS is about 14.5 years.

Frontline Treatments:
Lonafarnib: FDA-approved drug that helps reduce the accumulation of progerin, the protein responsible for the symptoms.
Combination Therapy: Use of lonafarnib with pravastatin and/or zoledronic acid.
Supportive Care: Cardiovascular monitoring, Nutritional support, Physical and occupational therapy, Dental Care, Management of Skeletal abnormalities

Criteria for Successful Treatment:
Improved Survival, Cardiovascular Improvements, Growth and Weight Gain, Bone Structure, Quality of Life, Reduction in Progerin Levels

Options if Frontline Therapies Fail: Still being researched
Gene Therapy with CRISPR, mTOR Inhibitors, Retinoids, NAD+ Boosters, Clinical trials, Enhanced Supportive Care

Tissues Affected by HGPS:
Cardivascular System- accelerated atherosclerosis and arterial stiffening
Skeletal System- bone development and structure
Skin- reduced elasticity, thinning of dermis, and loss of subcutaneous fat
Adipose Tissue- significant loss of subcutaneous fat
Renal System- renal failure
Endocrine System- growth hormone secretion and insulin sensitivity
Nervous System- neurodegeneration
Reproductive System- delayed or absent pubertal development
Gastrointestinal System- feeding difficulties, and reduced nutrient absorption
Immune System

Progerin is the main protein that causes most of the symptoms of HGPS and it affects different organs in different ways.

Seed Genes: LMNA and ZMPSTE24

Hypothesis: 
The LMNA and ZMPSTE24 genes cause symptoms associated with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome through the interaction of the ZMPSTE24 protein with the protein product of a mutated LMNA gene. The LMNA mutation causes an abnormal lamin A protein called progerin that becomes active when it interacts with ZMPSTE24, allowing the mutated protein to create unstable nuclear membranes, leading to the HGPS phenotype. Analysis of the attached PPI on Cytoscape will reveal the exact statistics that characterize the interaction between LMNA and ZMPSTE24 as well as the degree to which ZMPSTE24 effects the abnormal expression of LMNA.
